# F1-code-best-

THIS SIMULATION WAS CONSTRUCTED WITH THE USAGE OF PHYSICS FORMULAS 

Physics Formulas present in simulation :
- Downforce: `F = ½ρv²C_L A`
- Max corner speed: `v = √[μ(g + F/m)r]`

DOWNFORCE VARIABLES MEANINGS = 
½ρv² = (dynamic pressure of air hitting the wing):
ρ (rho): Air density (~1.225 kg/m³ at sea level)
v²: Speed squared (double speed = 4× stronger air pressure)
C_L is the lift coefficient:
Changes with wing angle (steep angle = higher C_L)


MAX CORNER SPEED VARIABLES = 
'V = velocity (max velocity in corner)

ρ = (air density) represents how thick the air is (~1.225 kg/m³ at sea level)

v² = (speed squared) shows why F1 cars grip exponentially better at high speeds (double speed = 4× downforce)

C<sub>L</sub> = (lift coefficient) depends on wing angle—steeper angles increase downforce but also drag

A (wing area) = reflects the size of aerodynamic surfaces

The downforce then determines maximum cornering speed via v = √[μ(g + F/m)r], where:

μ is tire grip (~2.0 for F1 slicks)
F/m proves lighter cars benefit more from downforce
r is the turn radius
